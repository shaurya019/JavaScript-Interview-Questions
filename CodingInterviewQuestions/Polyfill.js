// A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript) that provides functionality that is not natively supported by certain browsers or environments. It's used to ensure that web applications work consistently across different browsers and versions.

// For example, if you're using a new JavaScript feature like Array.prototype.includes that isn't available in older browsers, you can include a polyfill to add this method to those browsers.Here's a simple polyfill for Array.prototype.includes:


if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
    Array.prototype.includes = function(searchElement, fromIndex) {
      var list = Object(this);
      var length = list.length >>> 0;
      var i = fromIndex || 0;
      
      if (i < 0) {
        i = Math.max(length + i, 0);
      }
      
      for (; i < length; i++) {
        if (list[i] === searchElement) {
          return true;
        }
      }
      
      return false;
    };
}
  


// This code checks if Array.prototype.includes is already defined. If not, it adds a custom implementation so that the feature is available even in environments where it's not natively supported.

// Polyfills are essential for maintaining compatibility with older browsers and ensuring that modern web applications function correctly across a wide range of environments.
