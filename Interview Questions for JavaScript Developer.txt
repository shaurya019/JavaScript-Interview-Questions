1.Explain event delegation.
Answer: Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element rather than to individual child elements.
        Ex: Consider a list of items where you want to handle click events on each item. Instead of adding a click event listener to each item, you can add one event listener to the parent ul element.
